### More About Plan

First year students often have a hard time choosing courses. It’s better to plan ahead of time but it requires students to open several pages – the bulletin page for major requirements, a course search page to check time and enrollment information and a long course list of a department.

We made them all on one page and easy to follow when creating a plan. What’s cool about a plan is that you can create schedules for the future. As a freshman, you might want to know how you can finish your degree. Brandeis doesn’t post future course data but we’ve computed the offering chance for you based on the past offering history. So you can create a plan for your 4 years at Brandeis.

### Voice Search

You can click the mic icon under the search box and make a complex search like "Show me COSI courses taught by Timothy Hickey for Fall 2016".
