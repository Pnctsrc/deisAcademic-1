Students are encouraged to become experts in the theory and practice of her or his chosen area of research, as well as to obtain breadth in other areas strongly represented in the program. Graduate courses are available in the areas of cognitive, computational, and cellular neuroscience.</p><p>Graduate students will be eligible for an MS in neuroscience by completing six graduate-level lecture courses in neuroscience, along with registering for and completing the appropriate Journal Clubs (NBIO306a/b or NBIO340a/b) in the first two semesters of the first year and the Graduate Student Research Seminar (BIOL 350a/b) in the first two semesters of the first year. The six lecture courses must include NBIO 140b, the Masters Proseminar course (BIOL 250a), and one laboratory or research-based course, with the balance of courses being graduate-level neuroscience or biology courses. However, it is the aim of the program to be flexible and allow students to fill gaps in their education. Thus, if warranted, non-graduate courses or courses outside of neuroscience or biology can be taken if&nbsp;to be agreed upon with the program advisor. The laboratory or research component can be met by a Masters Research Lab (NEUR 296a), a Project Laboratory (BIOL 155a, BIOL 156a, BIOL158b, BCHM155b, or NBIO157a), or Readings in Neuroscience (NEUR297a/b). Students who wish to fulfill this requirement through NEUR 296a must obtain approval from the faculty member in whose lab the research is to take place, and must submit a written laboratory report at the end of the semester. All students are required to take Responsible Conduct of Science (CONT 300b), usually offered in the spring. In order to earn a degree from this program, the student must complete a minimum of 32 credits.</p><p>With approval of the supervising faculty member and the chair of the program, students have the option to write a Master’s Thesis (NEUR 299a) following completion of at least one full semester of Master’s Research Lab (NEUR 296a), provided that the research was performed in a single laboratory at Brandeis. Those who wish to complete a Master’s Thesis must obtain approval in the semester prior to when they will register for NEUR 299a (by November 1st if completing the thesis in the spring semester and by March 1st if completing the thesis in the fall semester). After completion and approval, the thesis must be deposited electronically in the Robert D. Farber University Archives at Brandeis.</p><p>Students must receive grades of B- or better in all courses and may be asked to leave the program at the end of a semester if their progress is found to be unsatisfactory by the graduate committee. Students wishing to be admitted to a second year of study must demonstrate adequate progress.</p><p><strong>Residence Requirement<br></strong> The minimum residence requirement for the MS degree is one year.</p><p>Students may take an additional one or two semesters to complete the MS degree as an Extended Master's student with approval of the chair of the program. International students may extend their time one semester if they are still completing required coursework. International students who have completed all required coursework and wish to complete the optional Master’s Thesis may stay an extra semester with advanced approval from the advising faculty, the program chair, and International Students &amp; Scholars Office (by November 1st if completing the thesis in the spring semester and by March 1st if completing the thesis in the fall semester).</p>",

            doctor: "<strong>Program of Study<br></strong> Students are expected to obtain knowledge of the principles and techniques in at least two of the areas represented in the program: cognitive, computational, systems, cellular, and molecular neuroscience. Students must take a total of six graduate-level courses for the degree, with two taken each semester in the first year. NBIO 140b (Principles of Neuroscience) and BIOL 200a (Proseminar ) are required in the first semester, and the four additional courses must be relevant to the student's area of interest, with at least one of these courses focusing on quantitative methods or approaches, and one of these courses focusing on critically reading, discussing, and writing about the primary scientific literature. All students are required to take CONT 300b, Responsible Conduct of Science, typically in the spring of their first year, and again in their fifth year. In addition, first-year students will complete four nine-week rotations (NEUR 300a/b) in at least four different laboratories. Throughout all graduate years, students must register for and participate in Journal clubs (NBIO 306a/b) and register for and present yearly (starting in their third year) in the Graduate Student Research Seminars (BIOL 350a/b). Presenting in the yearly Graduate Student Research Seminar is required to remain in good standing in the program. <p>The suggested schedule of course work for the first two years is:</p><p><strong>First Year</strong><br> Fall: NBIO 140b, BIOL 200a, NEUR 300a, NBIO 306a, BIOL 350a.<br> Spring: NEUR 300b, NBIO 306b, BIOL 350b, CONT 300b, and two courses selected from the neuroscience electives (typically NBIO 145b and NBIO 146a).</p><p><strong>Second Year</strong><br> Fall: NBIO 306a, BIOL 350a, and one course selected from the neuroscience electives.<br> Spring: NBIO 306b, BIOL 350b, and one course selected from the neuroscience electives.</p><p>It is recommended that students who were not able to take NBIO148b in their first year take it instead in their second year.</p><p>At the end of the first year after completing rotations, each student will choose his/her specific field of interest and will apply for a permanent adviser, to be mutually agreed upon by the student and the faculty member. Exceptions to this timeline are subjected to review by the Graduate Committee. The adviser will assist the student in planning a well-balanced thesis-research program in his/her specific field of interest with the objective and expectation of publishing the work. In addition, the adviser will ordinarily serve as the chair of the student's dissertation examining committee.</p><p><strong>Qualifying Examinations<br></strong> The qualifying examinations consist of two written propositions with accompanying oral exams. One of these shall be based on the research completed in one of the rotation laboratories&nbsp;(to be completed by the end of May in the first year), and the other takes the form of a formal thesis proposal (to be completed by May of the second year).</p><p><strong>Teaching Requirement<br></strong> As part of their PhD training, students act as teaching fellows for two semesters, typically in their second year.</p><p><strong>Residence Requirement<br></strong> The minimum residence requirement is three years.</p><p><strong>Language Requirement</strong><br> There is no foreign language requirement for the PhD degree. However, students for whom English is a second language are strongly recommended to take remedial English courses.</p><p><strong>Advancement in the Program</strong><br> Year One: The students must complete their formal courses, and four rotations, with a grade of B- or better. Each of four required lab rotations is evaluated by the supervising faculty member, who then submits a brief written report on the student’s performance to be included in the student’s permanent file. The written lab reports are reviewed by the rotation adviser and by the graduate committee. By the end of the first year, students should secure a thesis lab by mutual agreement with a faculty mentor. They must also successfully write, present, and pass their First Year Examination (Outside exam). The examination and students’ performance will be evaluated by the Graduate Committee members, and a written evaluation must be submitted to the Graduate Affairs Office.</p><p>At the discretion of the Graduate Committee, students who perform below the minimum expectations outlined above may not be re-admitted for the second year or may be placed on probation for one year. Students may be placed on probation as early as the end of first semester (pending unsatisfactory grades in both course work and rotations), and then asked to leave at the end of Year 1 if sufficient progress (as determined by the graduate committee) is not made in semester two.</p><p>Year Two: Grades in formal courses must be B- or better. The Graduate Committee evaluates the progress of each student at the end of the second year. Continuation in the program is decided based on a grade in all courses of B- or better (B if on probation), satisfactory teaching performance, and successful defense of the Second Year Examination (Inside exam). Students who had been placed on probation for the prior year must have displayed progress and must perform satisfactorily on the Second Year Examination. Students who perform below the minimum expectations as outlined above may not be readmitted for the third year and may be dismissed from the program. Students are expected to have all course and teaching requirements fulfilled before the start of their third year. Exceptions can be granted via approval of the Graduate Committee.</p><p>Once the Second Year Examination has been passed, each student is required to meet at least once a year with his or her Dissertation Committee to discuss progress toward the completion of the dissertation. These meetings must be documented with a form signed by the thesis committee members and turned into the Division of Science Graduate Affairs Office by the student. Progress will be reviewed by the graduate committee at the end of each year, and a student may be asked to leave the program if his/her progress is found to be unsatisfactory.</p><p><strong>Dissertation and Defense</strong><br> Each student will conduct an original investigation in the field of neuroscience under the direction of her/his research advisor and will write a dissertation of her/his results. After submission of the dissertation, the candidate will give a public seminar to the university community and then defend the work and its significance in an examination before a dissertation committee. The dissertation committee must include at least two Brandeis faculty members and one faculty member from outside the university. There is an expectation that students will publish two first-author research papers from their graduate work.</p><h4>Requirements for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Neuroscience with Specialization in Quantitative Biology</h4><p><strong>Program of Study<br></strong> Students wishing to obtain the specialization must first gain approval of the graduate program chair.

Alternatively, students may choose to focus their coursework to specialize their training in one or more of the anthropological subfields.</p><p><strong>Social-Cultural Anthropology Focus: Exploring Cross-Cultural Diversity and the Human Experience</strong><br> Social-cultural anthropologists examine contemporary societies and cultures in all their remarkable diversity and complexity. The majority of courses in the department's anthropology curriculum relate to social-cultural anthropology, a subfield that examines important dimensions of human life such as social inequalities and identities, political economies, gender systems, kinship and families, value and exchange, medicine and illness, religion, semiotic systems, visual cultures, migration and transnationalism, the cultural dimensions of globalization, understandings of the body and personhood, and the ways human beings interpret their worlds and make meaning in their lives. Social-cultural anthropologists study both their own and other societies as a means of better understanding both, and investigate vital questions about what it entails to be human.</p><p><strong>Archaeology Focus: Digging into Material Culture</strong><br> The goal of archaeology is to provide an anthropological perspective on societies from the appearance of human beings through to the present mostly via the study of material culture and organic remains. Archaeologists recover, document, analyze and interpret materials including architecture, landscapes, pottery, stone tools, inscriptions, funerary goods, plant remains, and human and faunal skeletons. Patterns in and of material culture provide insight into the nature of political orders, social arrangements, belief systems, the shift from foraging to agricultural economies, the inception of urban life, environmental transformations, and the rise and collapse of ancient polities among many other subjects.

ANTH 202b (Designing Anthropological Research) and ANTH 203b (Contemporary Anthropological Theory) within the first two years of residence. These three graduate foundational courses in anthropology emphasize epistemological issues in cross-cultural research and the relationship between scientific and humanistic modes of inquiry.

Subsequently, they engage in independent study in their areas of specialization and complete additional coursework, including reading courses and language training, as needed. Students then write an extended dissertation proposal that demonstrates mastery of relevant theoretical issues, historical and ethnographic material, and epistemological problems relevant to the proposed dissertation research. The proposal clearly articulates a research problem, specifies the kinds of data to be elicited, and proposes a cogent research design. Following preliminary approval by their advisory committee, students formally defend their proposals at a hearing before the department faculty. Students then normally apply for research grants to fund their project, engage in fieldwork and/or data gathering, and write and defend a doctoral dissertation.</p><p><strong>Language Requirements</strong><br> A reading knowledge of at least one foreign language must be demonstrated by written examination.</p><p><strong>Dissertation and Defense</strong><br> The completed dissertation must be successfully defended in an oral examination, as required by university regulations, before it can be formally accepted. At that point the department will recommend to the dean of arts and sciences that the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in anthropology be awarded to the candidate.</p>",

The first two years in the PhD program are devoted to coursework intended to provide the foundation of knowledge and experience necessary for embarking on a dissertation. Students normally take a total of sixteen semester courses over these two years. These courses include Directed Research, Regional Colloquia, Thematic Seminars, Field Courses, and Pedagogy. The specific requirements for coursework are minimal; in addition to their Directed Research, all students normally complete Introduction to Doctoral Studies in History, at least one Colloquium, and at least one Thematic Seminar.</p><p>The sine qua non of preparation for dissertation work is primary-source research, which is a central focus of the first year. Half of a student’s workload each semester that year consists of Directed Research, working with a Brandeis historian (chosen in consultation with the Director of Graduate Studies) to complete an article-length essay analyzing primary sources.</p><p>All first-year doctoral students must take at least one 200-level course in addition to Introduction to Doctoral Studies. During their second year doctoral students must take at least two graduate seminars.</p><p>During the first or second year, each student typically takes at least one course designed to introduce major themes and scholarly approaches to historical study of a given region. These Regional Colloquia are currently offered in American, European, and World History.</p><p>Additional courses are selected in consultation with faculty members to best meet the specific needs and interests of individual students. These electives may include Field Courses devoted to in-depth study of a particular era or methodological approach, and Thematic Seminars, broad and transnational courses of interest to historians irrespective of regional specialization. In addition, students normally take at least one course outside the discipline of history, whether at Brandeis or within the Graduate Consortium.</p><p>Pedagogy courses are taken in the second year, accompanying students’ work as Teaching Fellows.</p><p><strong>Residency Requirement<br></strong> The residency requirement for doctoral students in History is three years.<strong><br><br> Language Requirement<br></strong> All students are expected to demonstrate proficiency in at least one foreign language by the end of their second year.&nbsp; Many specializations require proficiency in two or more foreign languages.<span>&nbsp;</span> Proficiency is normally tested by a written translation exam, offered each semester.<span>&nbsp;</span> Students may use alternative means of demonstrating proficiency on petition to the Director of Graduate Studies.</p><p><strong>Comprehensive Examination</strong></p><p><strong>Outside Field</strong></p><p>Before taking the oral exam, all doctoral students must obtain a certificate from a Brandeis professor confirming that they have taken a course in either (a) a discipline outside of history that complements historical studies, such as anthropology, sociology, or literary studies, or (b) the history of a country or region outside of their main research focus. The certifying professor may also require that the student prepare a reading list or a proposed course syllabus. The selection of course and professor should be made in consultation with the Director of Graduate Studies.</p><p><strong>Major Field</strong></p><p>After completing the certification of an Outside Field, students must pass a comprehensive oral examination in their major field of historical interest. Within the major field the candidate will be examined by two professors in two broadly conceived subfields, to be determined by the student in consultation with the examiners and the Director of Graduate Studies, for 30-45 minutes each. Frequently these subfields will be defined chronologically but sometimes a student may wish to focus on a thematic or a methodological field. Each examining professor will ask the student to prepare a list of some 50 to 75 books that are crucial to the student’s field of inquiry. Normally students must pass their exam by the end of the fourth or the beginning of the fifth semester. Students with compelling reasons to make different course arrangements before the general examination may petition the graduate program to do so.</p><p><strong>Teaching Requirement</strong><br> Doctoral students must teach during five of their ten funded semesters, normally in years two through four. Typically, a student will serve four times as a teaching fellow in a History course, one time as the instructor in a University Writing Seminar.</p><p><strong>Dissertation</strong><br> After completing the qualifying examination, students begin research on their dissertation. Working with a primary advisor and a second reader (both from the Graduate Faculty in History unless approved by the Director of Graduate Studies), students prepare a proposal of 15-30 pages describing the dissertation's topic, source based, and historical significance.<span>&nbsp;</span> The prospectus will be presented publicly to the faculty and graduate students in the History Department. After the proposal is presented and accepted, the student will be considered advanced to candidacy.</p><p>When ready to defend their completed dissertation, students consult with their primary advisor and the Director of Graduate Studies to constitute, formally, the dissertation committee. Normally that committee includes the primary advisor, the second reader, and an outside reader drawn from the faculty of another university. With the approval of their committees, students arrange a public dissertation defense.</p>",

In the second term, first-year students will take Advanced Psychological Statistics II (PSYC 210b), a Proseminar in Brain, Body, and Behavior (PSYC 300a or 302a), and Ethical Practice in Health Related Sciences (CONT 300b). This non-credit course on ethics must be repeated in the 5th year for students on NIH fellowships. In the second year, students will take two elective courses in the first term and one elective plus the other Proseminar in Brain, Body, and Behavior (PSYC 300a or 302a) and PSYC 250a for their NRSA proposal preparation in the second term. One elective course is required each term in the third year.

Exceptions can also be made for advanced students with permission of the head of the graduate program.</p><p>In addition to the courses described in the preceding paragraphs, students are required to take one research course each semester from the PSYC 200a-245a series taught by their primary advisor until their dissertation proposal has been approved, after which they must register for PSYC 400d.&nbsp;In the first semester of year 2, students should additionally register for an independent research course using the course number assigned to their lab rotation advisor.</p><p><strong>Brain, Body, and Behavior Training in Psychology</strong><br> Students have the option to follow this curriculum, described below, which provides an emphasis on the interface of psychology and biomedical sciences. Students who apply successfully for appointment to the Brain, Body, and Behavior training grant must follow the curriculum, but all students are welcome to follow it. Each student will be required to follow all program requirements described above, and, within these constraints, must complete an augmented interdisciplinary, biomedical curriculum that encompasses coursework and research:</p><p><em>Brain, Body, and Behavior Research Requirement:</em> The requirement can be satisfied in one of three ways: 1) conduct one of the required PhD research projects with dual research mentors in a biomedical laboratory as well as in a psychological laboratory or 2) with a single mentor whose work inherently integrates the two disciplines, or 3) complete a rotation (required for all PhD students) in a biomedical laboratory. The student's plan must be approved by the Director of the Brain, Body and Behavior training program and the Director of Graduate Studies. Though some Psychology laboratories use biomedical techniques, the term \"biomedical laboratory\" above refers to a non-Psychology laboratory that employs techniques such as genetics and genomics, biochemistry, biophysics, immunology, and others that are not typically available in Psychology laboratories.</p><p><em>Brain, Body, and Behavior Course Requirement:</em> The Brain, Body and Behavior course requirements are two content courses that satisfy the biomedical breadth requirements (the list of approved courses is updated annually). (Courses taken to satisfy the biomedical breadth requirement can double count for the advanced elective core PhD requirements). Brain, Body and Behavior students may attend an approved biomedical seminar, colloquium or journal club in place of one of the biomedical elective courses. Detailed information about approved courses and colloquia is available on the Department of Psychology website.</p><p><strong>Breadth Requirement<br></strong> All PhD students must demonstrate breadth in the field of psychology. This breadth requirement is fulfilled by demonstrating competence in at least six of the nine areas listed below. The requirements may be satisfied in any of three ways:</p><p><strong>A.</strong> By having completed an undergraduate or graduate course in that area (equivalent to Brandeis 100-level or above).</p><p><strong>B.</strong> By completing an undergraduate or graduate course offered in that area at Brandeis (100-level or above).</p><p><strong>C.</strong> By successfully passing the equivalent of any undergraduate final examination for that course.</p><p>Of the six courses, a minimum of two must be taken from areas in Group A, a minimum of two from areas in Group B and, for BBB students, a minimum of two from areas in Group C.</p><p>Group A</p><ol><li>Physiological/Sensory Processes</li><li>Perception</li><li>Learning/Comparative</li><li>Cognition/Memory</li><li>Cognitive Science/Linguistics</li></ol><p>Group B</p><ol><li>Developmental</li><li>Social</li><li>Personality</li><li>Abnormal</li></ol><p>Group C (BBB Students)</p><ol><li>Brain Imaging</li><li>Behavioral Genomics</li><li>Computational Modeling</li><li>Biomechanics</li><li>System Control Theory</li><li>Principles of Neuroscience</li><li>Non-linear Dynamics</li><li>Genetics: Cellular &amp; Molecular</li><li>Developmental Biology</li><li>Genetics &amp; Human Heredity</li><li>Human Disease</li><li>Other Approved Topic</li></ol><p>All students must complete the Breadth Requirement From before submitting their dissertation proposal, usually in the third year. The form can be found on the Psychology Department’s Forms for Current Students page.</p><p><strong>Teaching Fellow Requirement<br></strong> As an integral part of the graduate training program, all students are normally required to serve as teaching fellows six (6) times according to the following schedule: once during the second semester of year 1; once during both semesters of years 2 and 3; and once during year 4. The TF requirement can be reduced for students appointed to qualifying research training grants, with the schedule depending on the period of appointment. All teaching fellows work closely with course instructors and receive guidance in all aspects of course preparation, teaching, and grading. Through exposure to different professors' styles, varied course formats, and presentations on teaching skills throughout their graduate training, teaching fellows come away with a wide range of experiences, providing them with invaluable preparation for academic positions. The workload varies according to the course and the time of the semester, but will average no more than 10 hours per week.</p><p><strong>Language Requirement<br></strong> There is no foreign language requirement.</p><p><strong>Dissertation and Defense<br></strong> <em>Overview</em>. Following the completion of the required pre-doctoral research reports, the student will prepare a prospectus of the proposed dissertation study including the student’s preliminary research and a review of relevant research in consultation with a faculty dissertation advisor, as well as a research proposal that includes a detailed description of methods and a brief description of planned analyses.</p><p><em>Dissertation Proposal Defense</em>. The Dissertation Proposal must be submitted by January 15th of the student’s third year. An oral examination of the Dissertation Proposal must be successfully completed by May 31st of the third year, at the latest. The written Dissertation Proposal and its oral defense must be approved by a committee of three Brandeis Psychology faculty members selected in advance by the student in consultation with his/her research mentor(s) and formally appointed by the Director of Graduate Studies. An additional committee member from outside the department or university will also be appointed either to participate at this stage of proposal approval or later in the process, as deemed appropriate by the Brandeis committee members. The dissertation advisor will serve as chair of the committee and will be responsible for advising the student throughout the performance of his or her work, in consultation with the remaining members of the committee, and annually reviewing progress of the work and reporting to the program faculty. The proposed dissertation should provide evidence of originality, scholarship, and research ability. It should be a contribution to knowledge, ordinarily an experimental investigation, but not necessarily so.</p><p><em>Statistics Defense</em>. The student must submit a written version of the Introduction, Methods and Results at least two weeks prior to a scheduled Statistics Defense meeting with the committee. At that meeting, the committee will discuss with the student the adequacy of the student's data analysis and/or modeling. The committee member from outside the department does not typically participate at this meeting, but may do so if his or her statistical or modeling expertise is deemed critical. After the Statistics Defense, the student will complete a summary of any additional analyses and edits to the Results section deemed necessary. Committee members will indicate their approval of this summary by signing a document indicating that the student has successfully completed the Statistics Defense. This document can be found on the Psychology Department’s <a href=\"http://www.brandeis.edu/departments/psych/doctoral/forms.html\" target=\"_blank\">Forms for Current Students</a> page. After the mentor has verified that the agreed-upon edits to the Results section have been incorporated into the final version of the dissertation, the final defense may be scheduled.</p><p><em>Dissertation Defense</em>. The final dissertation must be submitted to the committee, including the outside member, at least one month in advance of the scheduled Dissertation Defense unless the committee members all agree to a shorter lead time. The committee members must all approve the dissertation as eligible for a defense at least two weeks before the scheduled defense, at which time the dissertation must be deposited in the program office, where it will be available for inspection by all interested members of the faculty for at least two weeks prior to the final oral examination. After the Dissertation Defense, signatures of approval by all members of the dissertation committee, attesting both an acceptable written dissertation and a successful oral defense of the dissertation must be provided to the Department Chair together with a copy of the dissertation. The Chair will then recommended to the Faculty Council of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences award of the Ph.D. degree to the student.</p>",

The stand-alone MA degree in Sociology is designed for completion in either two or three semesters, with the degree awarded at the next official University degree conferral after completion of residence and requirements. Each MA degree candidate will devise a specialized program with a faculty adviser.</p><p>To fulfill program requirements for either the stand-alone or in-passing MA, students must complete eight courses. At least five of these courses must be taken in the Sociology Department at Brandeis. One course must be the MA proseminar OR one full year of SOC 300a, (available to students working toward the in-passing MA.) At least two other courses must be Sociology graduate seminars (courses numbered 200 or higher) or joint undergraduate/graduate seminars. One of the eight required courses must be in research methods and one must be in social theory. The research methods and theory classes can be taken in any department with the approval of the Graduate Committee. One course must be an independent study through which students are working on their final project OR an exam preparation course which students enroll in the semester before they complete the MA exam. One course may be an internship (SOC 292a). For upper-division courses (numbered 100 or higher) to be given graduate level credit, they should be supplemented by additional meetings, readings, and/or written work; the form that this enhancement will take should be worked out with the course instructor in the first two weeks of the course.</p><p>All MA students will complete either a Master's project or the MA exam. Students completing the program in two semesters will take the exam. Students completing the program in three semesters will complete the project.</p><p>The MA exam is a take-home (72-hour) examination given in the last week of classes of the spring semester. Two Sociology Department faculty members, either from the Graduate Committee or selected by the Graduate Committee, will draft the exam. These same faculty members will read the exam, which will be graded on a pass/fail basis. The exam will include two questions that draw on the coursework students have taken in theory and research methods as well as on their substantive interests. Students will be notified of their grade on the exam within two weeks of handing in the essays. Any student who fails the exam will be given the option to retake it once – the following spring.</p><p>The MA project may be a research paper of professional quality and length or a project a student develops in consultation with her or his adviser and the Graduate Committee. Students completing a Master's project will choose two faculty members of the Sociology department, one of whom is designated as chair, to guide and review the project. Both faculty members must communicate their approval of the project to the department Graduate Administrator before the University deadline for certifying degree requirements.</p><p>Students enrolled in the stand-alone MA program will be assigned a faculty adviser when they begin the program. At the start of the first semester, students are required to submit their plan of study for the year (agreed on with their adviser) to the Graduate Committee for approval. They must submit an update to that plan, including more specific details about the final project or decision to take the MA exam, to the Graduate Committee before the end of the add-drop period of the spring semester.</p><p><strong>Language Requirement<br></strong> There is no foreign language requirement for the Master's degree.</p><p><strong>Residence Requirement<br></strong> Nine months. The program may take an additional one or two semesters to complete as an Extended Master's student.</p>",

Credit for the sixth semester of SOC 300a is dependent on the student submitting a single-authored publishable research paper to a peer-reviewed academic journal. Students will additionally complete fourteen other courses. At least six of these courses must be formal graduate seminars offered by the Brandeis sociology department. One of those six seminars must be in social theory and one must be in research methods. Four additional courses must be completed within the Brandeis sociology department, either as graduate seminars, independent readings, advanced undergraduate/graduate seminars, or upper-division courses. The four remaining courses can be taken as the student chooses, including graduate courses at other Boston-area universities, in consultation with her or his adviser. The initial program of study is arranged in consultation with the graduate student’s adviser. Consideration will be given to graduate work done elsewhere, but formal transfer credit is assigned only after the successful completion of the first year of study. Each spring, students are required to complete self-evaluation forms that are reviewed by the department faculty to monitor progress.</p><p><strong>Teaching Requirement<br></strong> It is required that all PhD students participate in undergraduate teaching. This typically means leading discussion sections or otherwise working in collaboration with individual professors. PhD students receiving stipends are required to serve as teaching fellows or research fellows during their first eight semesters in residence. All students also have an opportunity to develop the craft of teaching through teaching workshops within the department and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.</p><p><strong>Residence Requirement<br></strong> The minimum residence for the PhD is three years.</p><p><strong>Language Requirement<br></strong> There is no foreign language requirement for the PhD.</p><p><strong>Qualifying Examinations<br></strong> The specific planning, evaluation, and accreditation of a student's course of study will be in the hands of each student's Qualifying Portfolio and Defense (QPD)&nbsp;Committee, comprising three Brandeis sociology faculty members. Along with the student, this committee will lay out a general course of study designed to meet the interests and needs of the student. Upon completion of the plan, the student will take an oral qualifying examination covering general sociology and the areas of the student's special interests.</p><p><strong>Dissertation and the Final Oral Examination<br></strong> A dissertation proposal should be submitted soon after the QPD is&nbsp;completed. The dissertation committee should consist of three members from the sociology department faculty and an outside reader chosen with the advice of the committee members and approved by the graduate committee and the Dean of the Graduate School.</p><p>The PhD dissertation may be accepted by the program upon the recommendation of the dissertation committee. To be granted the degree, the student is required to defend the dissertation in a public final oral examination.</p>",
