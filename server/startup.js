Students are encouraged to become experts in the theory and practice of her or his chosen area of research, as well as to obtain breadth in other areas strongly represented in the program. Graduate courses are available in the areas of cognitive, computational, and cellular neuroscience.</p><p>Graduate students will be eligible for an MS in neuroscience by completing six graduate-level lecture courses in neuroscience, along with registering for and completing the appropriate Journal Clubs (NBIO306a/b or NBIO340a/b) in the first two semesters of the first year and the Graduate Student Research Seminar (BIOL 350a/b) in the first two semesters of the first year. The six lecture courses must include NBIO 140b, the Masters Proseminar course (BIOL 250a), and one laboratory or research-based course, with the balance of courses being graduate-level neuroscience or biology courses. However, it is the aim of the program to be flexible and allow students to fill gaps in their education. Thus, if warranted, non-graduate courses or courses outside of neuroscience or biology can be taken if&nbsp;to be agreed upon with the program advisor. The laboratory or research component can be met by a Masters Research Lab (NEUR 296a), a Project Laboratory (BIOL 155a, BIOL 156a, BIOL158b, BCHM155b, or NBIO157a), or Readings in Neuroscience (NEUR297a/b). Students who wish to fulfill this requirement through NEUR 296a must obtain approval from the faculty member in whose lab the research is to take place, and must submit a written laboratory report at the end of the semester. All students are required to take Responsible Conduct of Science (CONT 300b), usually offered in the spring. In order to earn a degree from this program, the student must complete a minimum of 32 credits.</p><p>With approval of the supervising faculty member and the chair of the program, students have the option to write a Master’s Thesis (NEUR 299a) following completion of at least one full semester of Master’s Research Lab (NEUR 296a), provided that the research was performed in a single laboratory at Brandeis. Those who wish to complete a Master’s Thesis must obtain approval in the semester prior to when they will register for NEUR 299a (by November 1st if completing the thesis in the spring semester and by March 1st if completing the thesis in the fall semester). After completion and approval, the thesis must be deposited electronically in the Robert D. Farber University Archives at Brandeis.</p><p>Students must receive grades of B- or better in all courses and may be asked to leave the program at the end of a semester if their progress is found to be unsatisfactory by the graduate committee. Students wishing to be admitted to a second year of study must demonstrate adequate progress.</p><p><strong>Residence Requirement<br></strong> The minimum residence requirement for the MS degree is one year.</p><p>Students may take an additional one or two semesters to complete the MS degree as an Extended Master's student with approval of the chair of the program. International students may extend their time one semester if they are still completing required coursework. International students who have completed all required coursework and wish to complete the optional Master’s Thesis may stay an extra semester with advanced approval from the advising faculty, the program chair, and International Students &amp; Scholars Office (by November 1st if completing the thesis in the spring semester and by March 1st if completing the thesis in the fall semester).</p>",

            doctor: "<strong>Program of Study<br></strong> Students are expected to obtain knowledge of the principles and techniques in at least two of the areas represented in the program: cognitive, computational, systems, cellular, and molecular neuroscience. Students must take a total of six graduate-level courses for the degree, with two taken each semester in the first year. NBIO 140b (Principles of Neuroscience) and BIOL 200a (Proseminar ) are required in the first semester, and the four additional courses must be relevant to the student's area of interest, with at least one of these courses focusing on quantitative methods or approaches, and one of these courses focusing on critically reading, discussing, and writing about the primary scientific literature. All students are required to take CONT 300b, Responsible Conduct of Science, typically in the spring of their first year, and again in their fifth year. In addition, first-year students will complete four nine-week rotations (NEUR 300a/b) in at least four different laboratories. Throughout all graduate years, students must register for and participate in Journal clubs (NBIO 306a/b) and register for and present yearly (starting in their third year) in the Graduate Student Research Seminars (BIOL 350a/b). Presenting in the yearly Graduate Student Research Seminar is required to remain in good standing in the program. <p>The suggested schedule of course work for the first two years is:</p><p><strong>First Year</strong><br> Fall: NBIO 140b, BIOL 200a, NEUR 300a, NBIO 306a, BIOL 350a.<br> Spring: NEUR 300b, NBIO 306b, BIOL 350b, CONT 300b, and two courses selected from the neuroscience electives (typically NBIO 145b and NBIO 146a).</p><p><strong>Second Year</strong><br> Fall: NBIO 306a, BIOL 350a, and one course selected from the neuroscience electives.<br> Spring: NBIO 306b, BIOL 350b, and one course selected from the neuroscience electives.</p><p>It is recommended that students who were not able to take NBIO148b in their first year take it instead in their second year.</p><p>At the end of the first year after completing rotations, each student will choose his/her specific field of interest and will apply for a permanent adviser, to be mutually agreed upon by the student and the faculty member. Exceptions to this timeline are subjected to review by the Graduate Committee. The adviser will assist the student in planning a well-balanced thesis-research program in his/her specific field of interest with the objective and expectation of publishing the work. In addition, the adviser will ordinarily serve as the chair of the student's dissertation examining committee.</p><p><strong>Qualifying Examinations<br></strong> The qualifying examinations consist of two written propositions with accompanying oral exams. One of these shall be based on the research completed in one of the rotation laboratories&nbsp;(to be completed by the end of May in the first year), and the other takes the form of a formal thesis proposal (to be completed by May of the second year).</p><p><strong>Teaching Requirement<br></strong> As part of their PhD training, students act as teaching fellows for two semesters, typically in their second year.</p><p><strong>Residence Requirement<br></strong> The minimum residence requirement is three years.</p><p><strong>Language Requirement</strong><br> There is no foreign language requirement for the PhD degree. However, students for whom English is a second language are strongly recommended to take remedial English courses.</p><p><strong>Advancement in the Program</strong><br> Year One: The students must complete their formal courses, and four rotations, with a grade of B- or better. Each of four required lab rotations is evaluated by the supervising faculty member, who then submits a brief written report on the student’s performance to be included in the student’s permanent file. The written lab reports are reviewed by the rotation adviser and by the graduate committee. By the end of the first year, students should secure a thesis lab by mutual agreement with a faculty mentor. They must also successfully write, present, and pass their First Year Examination (Outside exam). The examination and students’ performance will be evaluated by the Graduate Committee members, and a written evaluation must be submitted to the Graduate Affairs Office.</p><p>At the discretion of the Graduate Committee, students who perform below the minimum expectations outlined above may not be re-admitted for the second year or may be placed on probation for one year. Students may be placed on probation as early as the end of first semester (pending unsatisfactory grades in both course work and rotations), and then asked to leave at the end of Year 1 if sufficient progress (as determined by the graduate committee) is not made in semester two.</p><p>Year Two: Grades in formal courses must be B- or better. The Graduate Committee evaluates the progress of each student at the end of the second year. Continuation in the program is decided based on a grade in all courses of B- or better (B if on probation), satisfactory teaching performance, and successful defense of the Second Year Examination (Inside exam). Students who had been placed on probation for the prior year must have displayed progress and must perform satisfactorily on the Second Year Examination. Students who perform below the minimum expectations as outlined above may not be readmitted for the third year and may be dismissed from the program. Students are expected to have all course and teaching requirements fulfilled before the start of their third year. Exceptions can be granted via approval of the Graduate Committee.</p><p>Once the Second Year Examination has been passed, each student is required to meet at least once a year with his or her Dissertation Committee to discuss progress toward the completion of the dissertation. These meetings must be documented with a form signed by the thesis committee members and turned into the Division of Science Graduate Affairs Office by the student. Progress will be reviewed by the graduate committee at the end of each year, and a student may be asked to leave the program if his/her progress is found to be unsatisfactory.</p><p><strong>Dissertation and Defense</strong><br> Each student will conduct an original investigation in the field of neuroscience under the direction of her/his research advisor and will write a dissertation of her/his results. After submission of the dissertation, the candidate will give a public seminar to the university community and then defend the work and its significance in an examination before a dissertation committee. The dissertation committee must include at least two Brandeis faculty members and one faculty member from outside the university. There is an expectation that students will publish two first-author research papers from their graduate work.</p><h4>Requirements for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Neuroscience with Specialization in Quantitative Biology</h4><p><strong>Program of Study<br></strong> Students wishing to obtain the specialization must first gain approval of the graduate program chair. This should be done as early as possible, ideally during the first year of graduate studies.
