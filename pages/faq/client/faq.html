            <br>planDeis is a Justice Brandeis Semester project. We have four members in our team and we built this site as our team project for the course - Voice, Web and Mobile Applications. We think that the official course search site is too hard to use so we decided to make a cool one. And now we have planDeis. Our goal is to make this site useful to every single Brandeis student. So if you have any question/concern/suggestion, please tell us. And if you like it, please tell your friends about it!<br><br>

        <div class='collapse' id="q2">
            <br>In order to make this site really work for you, as a Brandeis student, we require you to log in with your Brandeis email account. In this way, we can make sure that the data we collect is reliable so we can provide you with better experience.<br><br>

        <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q3"><div class='grayText'><strong>Is it safe to log in with my Brandeis email account?</strong></div></a>
        <div class='collapse' id="q3">
            <br>We know some people might have this concern. But it's safe. If you don't trust us (trust us please!), you should trust Google, which will never share their users' passwords with anyone. If you want to know more, we use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth" target="_blank">OAuth</a>. So basically you authorize us to collect and use some of your profile information (we only save your email address to our database for the use and we will never know your password). And we will never ask for your password.<br><br>

        <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q4"><div class='grayText'><strong>Is the database safe? Will my information be stolen?</strong></div></a>
        <div class='collapse' id="q4">
            <br>We run our server on a machine located in Brandeis Computer Science department. That means any non-Brandeis IP has no access to this site. If you trust Brandeis, you should believe that the database is safe. We also have multiple layers of protection on our database, so that no one can get or modify any personal data without permission (unless they know some hacking techniques that we've never heard of). However, you are absolutely allowed to make any change to your own data as many times as you want. So no need to worry about losing your plans some day.<br><br>

        <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q5"><div class='grayText'><strong>What is a plan?</strong></div></a>
        <div class='collapse' id="q5">
            <br>Great question. When you want to create your schedules from Fall 2014 to Spring 2018 for a double major of Math and Computer Science, that's when you want to create a plan. It's a set of schedules over several semesters. The cool thing about our plan is that you can create future schedules.<br><br>
        </div>
        <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q6"><div class='grayText'><strong>What's cool about a plan?</strong></div></a>
        <div class='collapse' id="q6">
            <br>Sometimes it's inconvenient to open several sites and make your schedules. For example, there are bulletin page, course search page and sage, which takes a long time and you often have to go back and forth a lot. So we have put them all together. What's more, we have computed the chances of future offerings based on the past offering history of all courses, so that you can see how possible a course will be offered in a future semester. If you are a freshman and have no idea how you should arrange your four year schedules, this feature can be quite helpful to give you an idea of how your academic life at Brandeis will be. However, one thing to know is that Brandeis registrar is the one that makes the final decision. So it's very possible that a 99% percent course will not be offered that semester. The numbers we compute only come from the data of the past.<br><br>

        <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q7"><div class='grayText'><strong>How to create a plan?</strong></div></a>
        <div class='collapse' id="q7">
            <br>It's very easy. 
            <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&bull;</strong> Click "New Plan" on the side bar and you'll see a page where you can choose the term range and majors/minors for the plan.</div>
            <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&bull;</strong> Next, you'll be navigated to the course list page where you add the courses you need, according to the bulletin information on the right.</div>
            <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&bull;</strong> After adding the courses, you'll see the overview/calendar page where you can actually make your schedules and save the plan.</div>
            
            <br>Once you finish making a plan, you can view it by clicking "My Plan" when you click the profile icon on the side bar.

            <br><b>We are still adding the major information and if you can't see it on the page, there's a link to the bulletin page. We should fix this soon.<br><br></b>
        </div>
        <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q8"><div class='grayText'><strong>Why I can't find the course I need for the plan?</strong></div></a>
        <div class='collapse' id="q8">
            <br>Brandeis sometimes doesn't put things in the right category. For example, if you want to get a B.S. in Computer Science, you'll have to take MATH 10a and 8a. However, in Brandeis course data, these two classes are not categorized as Computer Science major courses. So if this happens, you can either search math 8a or 10a and add them to your wishlist or you can simply choose Math as your "second" major.
            <br><br>We are currently adding all the information by hand into our database so that some day in the future, you can automatically have your core courses added according to the degree you choose. However, this might take a long time (we're also trying to ask the school to post this data). So if you are willing to help us, you can send us an email and include the following:
            <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&bull;</strong> The name you want us to show on the page.</div>
            <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&bull;</strong> The name for the department and degree (e.g. Computer Science - BS).</div>
            <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&bull;</strong> The core courses that are required by the degree (all uppercase - like MUS 101A).</div>
            <br>
            Once you send us the email and the information is all correct, the name you give us will show on the page so that everyone knows it's you who helps to make the function work.
            <br><br>
            We'll keep a list of the received ones here so that you don't repeat others' works.
            We really appreciate your help!<br><br>

        <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q9"><div class='grayText'><strong>Where did you get all the course data?</strong></div></a>
        <div class='collapse' id="q9">
            <br>We get all the data from Brandeis. LTS will publish the course data every few minutes. So the sad news is that, during the shopping period, the enrollment information can't be up-to-date. So when you see the current enrollment of a section is 44/45, it's very possible that it is actually closed now. But other information is all up-to-date and accurate!<br><br>
        </div>
        <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q10"><div class='grayText'><strong>Wait! What if I'm off campus?</strong></div></a>
        <div class='collapse' id="q10">
            <br>It's easy. You can use Junos Pulse, a free VPN provided by Brandeis LTS. Log in with your actual Brandeis username and password, then you can enjoy a safe connection to the campus. Most importantly, you get the access to planDeis!<br>

            <br>So here's the <a href="https://kb.brandeis.edu/display/LTS/Junos+Pulse" target="_blank">step by step guide</a> from LTS website. Once you finish the set up, the next time you can establish the connection by one click.<br><br>

        <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q11"><div class='grayText'><strong>Will there be any new feature?</strong></div></a>
        <div class='collapse' id="q11">
            <br>Here are some of the new features we are going to add:
            <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&bull;</strong> A statistics page where you can see how many people of the same major are taking the course or when students usually take a course.</div>
            <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&bull;</strong> A page where you can view other people's plans and help you make your decision.</div>
            <br>
            <div>
                These features need lots of data. So it is important that you complete your profile, share your plans with others, make an official plan and tell more people about our site! For more information about sharing plans or creating an official one, you can go to your profile page.<br><br>
